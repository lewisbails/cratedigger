# Crate Digger

Pretty simple app that checks what you're playing on Spotify and presents some stats on the track, shows the official video (or at least the top search result on YouTube), presents some related artists you can click on for a random track, and has a controller section for usual playback operations (including a Fresh button for some tracks I'm liking at the moment). All done with React and a few other libraries.
